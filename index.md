A day-long cyber security competition will take place 
on Friday, May 7, 2010.

This hackfest will pit two teams (Red Team vs. Blue Team) against each
other in a fierce battle to defend their networks while simultaneously
attempting to infiltrate their opponentâ€™s network. 

Various tasks scattered throughout the competition will be given by
the administrative team (White Team) to further complicate
things. White will also confuse and disrupt Red and Blue by similarly
attempting to infiltrate their networks.

Any interested spectator may join the fun by taking an ephemeral
position with White in an attempt to attack Red and Blue; therefore,
bringing laptops loaded with the latest and greatest network
infiltration tools is invited!
