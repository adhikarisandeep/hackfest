Project Hosting
---------------

Since we will have multiple programmers working on this project, we
will need to make the code easily available. As such, it would be
advantageous to host our project somewhere on web. Several project
hosting sites exist that provide a number of useful tools for managing
large software projects. Two of the more popular sites are `Google Code`
and `Github`.

Both of these sites provide the following services

 * Free hosting
 * Version control systems
 * Wiki pages
 * Issue trackers

One of the key benefits of using a project hosting site is their
integration with version control systems.  Github uses `Git` and 
Google Code uses `Mercurial`. Both of these programs are known as 
`DVCS`, or distributed version control systems and have similar 
interfaces for using them.

Further research is required before we select which service to use.
